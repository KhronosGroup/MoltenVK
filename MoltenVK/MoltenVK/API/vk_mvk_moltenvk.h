/**
 * MoltenVK configuration settings.
 *
 * To be active, some configuration settings must be set before a VkDevice is created.
 * See the description of the individual configuration structure members for more information.
 *
 * There are three mechanisms for setting the values of the MoltenVK configuration parameters:
 *   - Runtime API via the vkGetMoltenVKConfigurationMVK()/vkSetMoltenVKConfigurationMVK() functions.
 *   - Application runtime environment variables.
 *   - Build settings at MoltenVK build time.
 *
 * To change the MoltenVK configuration settings at runtime using a programmatic API,
 * use the vkGetMoltenVKConfigurationMVK() and vkSetMoltenVKConfigurationMVK() functions
 * to retrieve, modify, and set a copy of the MVKConfiguration structure.
 *
 * The initial value of each of the configuration settings can established at runtime
 * by a corresponding environment variable, or if the environment variable is not set,
 * by a corresponding build setting at the time MoltenVK is compiled. The environment
 * variable and build setting for each configuration parameter share the same name.
 *
 * For example, the initial value of the shaderConversionFlipVertexY configuration setting
 * is set by the MVK_CONFIG_SHADER_CONVERSION_FLIP_VERTEX_Y at runtime, or by the
 * MVK_CONFIG_SHADER_CONVERSION_FLIP_VERTEX_Y build setting when MoltenVK is compiled.
 *
 * This structure may be extended as new features are added to MoltenVK. If you are linking to
 * an implementation of MoltenVK that was compiled from a different VK_MVK_MOLTENVK_SPEC_VERSION
 * than your app was, the size of this structure in your app may be larger or smaller than the
 * struct in MoltenVK. See the description of the vkGetMoltenVKConfigurationMVK() and
 * vkSetMoltenVKConfigurationMVK() functions for information about how to handle this.
 *
 * TO SUPPORT DYNAMIC LINKING TO THIS STRUCTURE AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THIS STRUCTURE SHOULD NOT
 * BE CHANGED EXCEPT TO ADD ADDITIONAL MEMBERS ON THE END. EXISTING MEMBERS, AND THEIR ORDER,
 * SHOULD NOT BE CHANGED.
 *
 * In addition to the configuration parmeters in this structure, there are several settings that
 * can be configured through runtime environment variables or MoltenVK compile-time build settings:
 *
 * 1. The MVK_CONFIG_LOG_LEVEL runtime environment variable or MoltenVK compile-time build setting
 *    controls the level of logging performned by MoltenVK using the following numeric values:
 *      0: No logging.
 *      1: Log errors only.
 *      2: Log errors and informational messages.
 *    If neither is set, errors and informational messages are logged.
 *
 * 2. Setting the MVK_CONFIG_TRACE_VULKAN_CALLS runtime environment variable or MoltenVK compile-time build
 *    setting will cause MoltenVK to log the name of each Vulkan call made by the application. The logging
 *    format options can be controlled by setting the value of MVK_CONFIG_TRACE_VULKAN_CALLS as follows:
 *        0: No Vulkan call logging.
 *        1: Log the name of each Vulkan call when the call is entered.
 *        2: Log the name of each Vulkan call when the call is entered and exited. This effectively
 *           brackets any other logging activity within the scope of the Vulkan call.
 *        3: Same as option 2, plus logs the time spent inside the Vulkan function.
 *
 * 3. Setting the MVK_CONFIG_FORCE_LOW_POWER_GPU runtime environment variable or MoltenVK compile-time
 *    build setting to 1 will force MoltenVK to use a low-power GPU, if one is availble on the device.
 *
 * 4. Setting the MVK_ALLOW_METAL_EVENTS runtime environment variable or MoltenVK compile-time build
 *    setting to 1 will cause MoltenVK to use Metal events, if they are available on the device, for
 *    Vulkan sychronization components such as VkSemaphore. This is disabled by default.

	 * If disabled, a single Metal command buffer will be created and filled when the Vulkan
	 * command buffers are submitted to the Vulkan queue. This allows a single Metal command
	 * buffer to be used for all of the Vulkan command buffers in a queue submission. The
