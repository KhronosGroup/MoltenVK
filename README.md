About This Document
-------------------

This document describes how to use the **MoltenVK** open-source repository to build a **MoltenVK** 
runtime distribution package.

To learn how to integrate the **MoltenVK** runtime into a game or application, see the 
[`Docs/MoltenVK_Runtime_UserGuide.md `](Docs/MoltenVK_Runtime_UserGuide.md) document in the `Docs` directory. 

If you are just looking for a pre-built **MoltenVK** runtime binary, you can download it as part of the 
[*LunarG SDK*](https://vulkan.lunarg.com).

Introduction
------------

**MoltenVK** is an implementation of the [*Vulkan 1.0*](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan) 
graphics and compute API, that runs on Apple's [*Metal*](https://developer.apple.com/metal) 
graphics and compute framework on both *iOS* and *macOS*.

**MoltenVK** allows you to use the *Vulkan* graphics and compute API to develop modern, 
cross-platform, high-performance graphical games and applications, and to run them across 
many platforms, including both *iOS* and *macOS*.

*Metal* uses a different shading language, the *Metal Shading Language (MSL)*, than 
*Vulkan*, which uses *SPIR-V*. **MoltenVK** automatically converts your *SPIR-V* shaders 
to their *MSL* equivalents.

To provide *Vulkan* capability to the *iOS* and *macOS* platforms, **MoltenVK** uses *Apple's* 
publicly available API's, including *Metal*. **MoltenVK** does **_not_** use any private or
undocumented API calls or features, so your app will be compatible with all standard distribution 
channels, including *Apple's App Store*.

**MoltenVK** contains two products:

- **MoltenVK** is an implementation of the [*Vulkan 1.0*](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan) 
  graphics and compute API.

- **MoltenVKShaderConverter** converts *SPIR-V* shader code to *Metal Shading Language (MSL)*
  shader code, and converts *GLSL* shader source code to *SPIR-V* shader code and/or
  *Metal Shading Language (MSL)* shader code. The *SPIR-V* converter is included in the 
  **MoltenVK** runtime to automatically convert *SPIR-V* shaders to their *MSL* equivalents. 
  In addition, both the *SPIR-V* and *GLSL* converters can be be packaged into a stand-alone 
  command-line *macOS* tool for converting shaders at development time.

Installing **MoltenVK**
-----------------------

To install **MoltenVK**, clone this `MoltenVK` repository, and then run the 
`fetchDependencies` script to retrieve and build several external 
open-source libraries on which **MoltenVK** relies:

1. Ensure you have `cmake` and `python3` installed:

		brew install cmake
		brew install python

   For faster dependency builds, you can also optionally install `ninja`:

		brew install ninja

2. Clone the `MoltenVK` repository:

		git clone https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK.git

3. Retrieve and build the external libraries:

		cd MoltenVK
		./fetchDependencies

For more information about the external open-source libraries used by **MoltenVK**,
see the [`ExternalRevisions/README.md`](ExternalRevisions/README.md) document.


<a name="building"></a>
Building **MoltenVK**
-------------------

At development time, **MoltenVK** references advanced OS frameworks during building.
 
- *Xcode 9* or above is required to build and link **MoltenVK** projects.

Once built, **MoltenVK** can be run on *iOS* or *macOS* devices that support *Metal*.

- **MoltenVK** requires at least *macOS 10.11* or  *iOS 9*.
- Information on *macOS* devices that are compatible with *Metal* can be found in 
  [this article](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2015/06/22/how-to-find-mac-el-capitan-metal-compatible).
- Information on compatible *iOS* devices that are compatible with *Metal* can be found in 
  [this article](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeviceInformation/Reference/iOSDeviceCompatibility/HardwareGPUInformation/HardwareGPUInformation.html).

>***Note:*** To support `IOSurfaces` on *iOS*, **MoltenVK**, and any app that uses **MoltenVK**, 
must be built with a minimum **iOS Deployment Target** (aka `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET `) build 
setting of `iOS 11.0` or greater.

The `MoltenVKPackaging.xcodeproj` *Xcode* project contains targets and schemes to build 
and package the entire **MoltenVK** runtime distribution package, or to build individual 
**MoltenVK** or **MoltenVKShaderConverter** components.

To build a **MoltenVK** runtime distribution package, suitable for testing and integrating into an app, 
open `MoltenVKPackaging.xcodeproj` in *Xcode*, and use one of the following *Xcode Schemes*:

- **MoltenVK Package (Release)** - build the entire **MoltenVK** runtime distribution package using the
  *Release* configuration.
- **MoltenVK Package (Debug)** - build the entire **MoltenVK** runtime distribution package using the
  *Debug* configuration.

Each of these`MoltenVKPackaging.xcodeproj` *Xcode* project *Schemes* puts the resulting packages in the 
`Package` directory, creating it if necessary. This directory contains separate `Release` and `Debug` 
directories, holding the most recent **Release** and **Debug** builds, respectively.

A separate `Latest` directory links to  the most recent build, regardless of whether it was a **Release** 
or **Debug** build. Effectively, the `Package/Latest` directory points to whichever of the `Package/Release` 
or `Package/Debug` directories was most recently updated.

With this packaging structure, you can follow the [instructions below](#using) to link your application 
to the **MoltenVK** frameworks in the `Package/Latest` directory, to provide the flexibility to test your 
app with either a **Debug** build, or a higher-performance **Release** build.


### Building from the Command Line

If you prefer to build **MoltenVK** from the command line, or to include the activity in a larger build script,
you can do so using the following command from within the `MoltenVK` repository:

	xcodebuild -project MoltenVKPackaging.xcodeproj -scheme "MoltenVK Package (Release)" build

or

	xcodebuild -project MoltenVKPackaging.xcodeproj -scheme "MoltenVK Package (Debug)" build



<a name="demos"></a>
Running the **MoltenVK** Demo Applications
------------------------------------------

Once you have compiled and built the **MoltenVK** runtime distribution package from this **MoltenVK** repository, 
as described in the [Building **MoltenVK**](#building) section, you can explore how **MoltenVK** provides *Vulkan* 
support on *iOS* and *macOS* by investigating and running the demo applications that are included in **MoltenVK**.

The **MoltenVK** demo apps are located in the `Demos` folder. Each demo app is available as an *Xcode* project.
To review and run the included demo apps, open the `Demos/Demos.xcworkspace` workspace in *Xcode*.

Please read the [`Demos/README.md`](Demos/README.md) document for a description of each demo app, and instructions 
on running the demo apps. Several of the demo apps allow you to explore a variety of *Vulkan* features by modifying
*Xcode* build settings. Additional demos can be downloaded and built from external repositories, as described in the
[`Demos/README.md`](Demos/README.md) document



<a name="using"></a>
Using **MoltenVK** in Your Application
--------------------------------------

Once you have compiled and built the **MoltenVK** runtime distribution package from this **MoltenVK** repository, 
as described in the [Building **MoltenVK**](#building) section, follow the instructions in the Installation 
section of the [`Docs/MoltenVK_Runtime_UserGuide.md`](Docs/MoltenVK_Runtime_UserGuide.md#install) document in the
`Docs` directory, to link the **MoltenVK** frameworks and libraries to your application.

The runtime distribution package in the `Package/Latest` directory is a stand-alone package, and you can copy 
the contents of that directory out of this **MoltenVK** repository into your own application building environment.



<a name="compliance"></a>

**MoltenVK** and *Vulkan* Compliance
------------------------------------

**MoltenVK** is designed to be a *Vulkan 1.0* driver that runs on *macOS* and *iOS* platforms by mapping *Vulkan*
capability to native *Metal* capability.

The fundamental design and development goal of **MoltenVK** is to provide this capability in a way that 
is both maximally compliant with the *Vulkan 1.0* specification, and maximally  performant.

Such compliance and performance is inherently affected by the capability available through *Metal*, as the 
native driver on *macOS* and *iOS* platforms. *Vulkan* compliance may fall into one of the following categories:

- Direct mapping between *Vulkan* capabilities and *Metal* capabilities. Within **MoltenVK**, almost all capability
  is the result of this type of direct mapping. 
  
- Synthesized compliance through alternate implementation. A very small amount of capability is provided using
  this mechanism, such as via an extra render or compute shader stage.

- Non-compliance. This appears where the capabilities of *Vulkan* and *Metal* are sufficiently different, that
  there is no practical, or reasonably performant, mechanism to implement a *Vulkan* capability in *Metal*. 
  Because of design differences between *Vulkan* and *Metal*, a very small amount of capability falls into this 
  category, and at present **MoltenVK** is **_not_** fully compliant with the *Vulkan* specification. A list of 
  known limitations is documented in the [`Docs/MoltenVK_Runtime_UserGuide.md`](Docs/MoltenVK_Runtime_UserGuide.md#limitations) 
  document in the `Docs` directory.

The **MoltenVK** development team welcomes you to [post Issues](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK/issues) 
of non-compliance, and engage in discussions about how compliance can be improved, and non-compliant features can 
be implemented or worked around.

**MoltenVK** is a key component of the [*Khronos Vulkan Portability Initiative*](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/portability-initiative), 
whose intention is to provide specifications, resources, and tools to allow developers to understand and design 
their *Vulkan* apps for maximum cross-platform compatibility and portability, including on platforms, such as 
*macOS* and *iOS*, where a native *Vulkan* driver is not available.
